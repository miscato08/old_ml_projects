# Old Machine Learning Projects
In this repository you can find old projects, I built the last year to get better in Machine Learning and to improve my skill. Maybe you find them interesting :)

### Fifa Data Scinece Project
* Here I tried to get better at data science
* I tried to import the Fifa Dataset from Kaggle and played a little around with some visualisation
* I used pandas, bokeh and seaborn

### Iris Projects
* Here I tried to build a model on the famous Iris Dataset
* I used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn, so it was pretty basic

### Image Recognition Project
* Here I tried to use the ImageAi library to build a little basic script for Image recoginition
